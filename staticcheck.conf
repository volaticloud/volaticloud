checks = ["all", "-ST1000", "-SA4006", "-ST1005"]

# Disabled checks:
# - ST1000: package comment requirement (not practical for generated code)
# - SA4006: this value is never used (false positives for reassignments)
# - ST1005: error string formatting (generated code doesn't follow Go conventions)
